# Coco &mdash; distributive, autonomous, anonymous, open-source, for-profit, collaborative platform based on virtual shares

Features
--------
* **Autonomous** &mdash; no boss, no management, no strict hierarchy.  Teams / clusters are formed according to needs.

* **Anonymous** &mdash; Members can only see contributions but not the identities of their originators.  Contributions are valued purely on their **intrinsic merits**.

* Contributors get **shares** instead of one-time income.  Projects can sustain for a long time as old members leave and new members join.

* Shares are assigned automatically according to **mutual peer rating**, and the rating scheme is **weighted**, ie, members with low contribution have low weights, so that **malicious attacks** would not affect the ratings.

* _Free_ open-source software _sucks_ because contributors don't get paid and they have to rely on grotesque, indirect means of income.  Recently there is a new **for-profit open-source** license called [License Zero](https://licensezero.com/) with additional terms stipulating that anyone who runs or deploys the software must pay for it according to separate license conditions.  Using of this license combined with our platform, makes the money-making process completely _automatic_.

which shows how peers can rate each other with scores that sum to 100%.
