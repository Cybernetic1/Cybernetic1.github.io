# Coco &mdash; distributive, autonomous, anonymous, open-source, for-profit, collaborative platform based on virtual shares

Features
--------
* **Autonomous** &mdash; no boss, no management, no strict hierarchy.

* **Anonymous** &mdash; contributions are valued purely on their merits

* Every contributor gets **shares** instead of one-time income.

* Shares are assigned automatically according to **mutual peer rating**, and the rating scheme is **weighted**, ie, members with low contribution have low weights, so they cannot _maliciously_ affect the projects.

* Free open-source software _sucks_ because contributors don't get paid and they have to rely on grotesquely indirect means of income.  Recently there is a new **for-profit open-source** license called [License Zero](https://licensezero.com/) with additional terms stipulating that anyone who runs or deploys the software must pay for it according to separate license conditions.

Try out the (very simple) GUI here:

which shows how peers can rate each other with scores that sum to 100%.
